# Sensors, actuators and types of interaction

**Smart objects** are objects that embed electronics, including sensors, actuators, wireless connectivity, and a processing unit.

**Sensors** are devices that detect a physical change in some characteristic that change in response to some excitation and convert that into an electrical signal.

**Actuators** are devices that convert an electrical signal into a physical quantity that affects the world.

Combining data from several objects (belonging to different users) can result in new knowledge available to the user to make suggestions for lifestyle improvements (through Big Data analysis techniques).

## Sensors

**Input**

- Body movement (e.g., via accelerometers, gyroscopes)

- Speech (via speech recognition systems)

- Facial recognition (e.g., via cameras)

- Gaze (via eye-tracker)

- Digital pen

- Biometric data (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance)

- Brain activity (e.g., via brain-computer interfaces)

**Output**

- Visual

- Auditory

- Haptic

- Scent

- Taste

Sensors can track gestures, biometric parameters or properties of an environment.

**Examples**

- switch

- potentiometer

- proximity sensor

- pressure sensor

- flex sensor

- ribbon sensors

- accelerometer

- IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), acceleometer, magnetometer and gyro

- joystick

- hall effect sensor (Hall effect sensors detect whether a magnet is near (no 
  need to touch))

- ...biometrics

- ...enviroment 

## Actuators

Actuators are devices that affect the world.

- Visual stimuli

- Sound stimuli

- Haptic stimuli

## Interactions

You need to design which are the gestures of users on your object and/or which quantities need to be measured and collected.

- Discrete interactions - user interacts in a discrete way, limited numer of states (*ex. button*)

- Continuous interactions - user interacts in a continuous way (*es pressure sensor*)
  
  

- Touch-based

- Touchless
  
  

- Synchronus - immediatly

- Asynchronus - after delay
  
  

- Individual

- Collaborative



- Situated - user interacts with the system in the same physical space

- Remote - user interacts with the system in different spaces (through communication network)



- Networked situated interactions
  
  - *A musician controls in realtime via a tablet the smart guitar configuration while the guitarist is playing it (the smart guitar is a hub for collaborative music making)*

- Networked remote interactions
  
  - *Telepresence systems (set of technologies that allow a person to feel as if others were present)*
  
  - *Industry 4.0*

## Unimodal and multimodal interactions

**Mode** refers to the communication through one sensory channel, to acquire or convey information.

**Unimodal interactions** - The user interacts with the system by using one single 
interaction modality as input or output

**Multimodal interactions** - The user interacts with the system by using more than one interaction modality as input or output

**Multisensory systems** aim at making communication with machines more natural, more efficient, and more engaging.

**User interfaces are evolving towards multisensoriality.**

Two main goals:  

1. To achieve an interaction closer to natural human-human communication
2. To increase the robustness of the interaction by using 
   redundant or complementary information
