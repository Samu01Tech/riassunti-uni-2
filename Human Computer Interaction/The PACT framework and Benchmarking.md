# The PACT framework and Benchmarking

## Recap

- IxD is a process (4 phases), a creative activity and it is based on interactions. 

- It follows the philosophy of user-centered design

- Goal is to develop usable products and enjoyable user experience

- Important to not jump into decisions from start

- Usability is a quality attribute of a product, mainly aout the functional part of the product

- User Experience refers to subjective feelings abouut using the product

## Exploring the PACT Analysis

To reach usability goals (effectiveness, efficiiency, ...) we conduct **usability test**, which are put in practice as questions.

You analyze **People**, **Activities**, **Context** and **Technology**, one by one. Iteration is always the key.

## People

- **primary**: direct interaction, frequent use

- **secondary**: occasional use or via someone else

- **tertiary**: affected by its introduction, will influence its purchase

*example - a software for tracking and monitoring the mental decline of people at high risk of dementia*

```
interact: elderly people
manage: doctor relatives
output: doctor relatives
purchase: doctor
decision: relatives
competitor: 


PRIMARY: elderly
SECONDARY: care givers
TERTIARY: doctors, relatives
```

Understanding **inidividual differences** can help designers. 

**Variabilities**: 

- Physical (strength, different sensory abilities)

- Psycologically (cognitive development, impairments, fatigue, stress)

- Socially and Culturally

### Accessibility

**Accessibility**: extent interactivity of a product, especially for disabilities

**Inclusiveness**: making products accomodate the widest possible number of people

### Cultural differences

Dates for example change between countries. The solution is to force the user to input a date in a specific day:

## Activities

- **complexity** of the activity

- **impact of error**

- **nature** of the content

*example - same as before*

```
pragmatic
regular
time yes
continuous
not
may not insert correct data
```

## Context

- **Physical** (place)

- **Social** (individual vs group activity, needs computer)
  
  - keep privacy in mind

- **Psycological** (motivation, stress, emotion)

*example*

```
at home, calm ambient, elderly house
individual, interaction with app
may forget, does not fill data, support!
```

## Technology

- **Input** (getting data, security)

- **Output** (videos and picture)

- **Communication** (people to people, devices, web)

- **Content** (wwhat tto show)

## Benchmarking

It is a method created and mostly used in the business sector. It aim to identify the best solutions (product/practices) existing. You get **reference points** and then **compare**.

Goals of benchmarking is to ahave a general overview of the current systems and get inspiration for the design (as a design library).

1.  Collect from the web **examples** of systems related to your problem
   
   1. focus on specific domain
   
   2. keywords
   
   3. look for physical devices also

2. Create a presentation
   
   1. Name
   
   2. Representative image
   
   3. Short description of how it works
   
   4. URL
   
   5. Keywords why is interesting

3. Classify the examples found by affinity
   
   1. Orthogonal axes
   
   2. Conceptual map

## Project

1. Benchmarking

2. Ideation

3. 2 iteration of
   
   1. PACT
   
   2. Design
   
   3. Prototyping
   
   4. Evaluation
