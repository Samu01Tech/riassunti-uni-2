# HCI, IoT and AI

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects (or “things”) embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

The Internet of Things allows people and things to be connected anytime, anywhere, with anything and anyone.

## Data fusion

Data collected by sensors needs to be transformed into meaningful and task relevant information.  Data fusion consists in combine data from multiple sensors to improve accuracy of the data. 

HCI should focus on how computing could be added to everyday objects, and what this can enable for users, usually to make suggestions for lifestyle improvements.

## How

- Design products and services that solve users’ pain points and add value to people’s lives

- The key is to understand users

Today the interaction with devices is getting more and more ubiquitous. Devices can collect and exploit “**contextual** information”. **Ubiquitous Computing** is computing that occurs anytime and everywhere.

## Ubiquitous Computing

Typical properties of ubiquitous interaction

- Occurring all the time 

- Occurring everywhere

- Transparent to the user

- Informed by context

## Context

Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity. A system is **context-aware** if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, where relevancy depends on the user’s task.

## AI

AI is a set of technologies that allow machines to perceive, understand, act, and learn from experience.

Roles:

- Classification

- Prediction

### Types of interactions

**Strictly tool-based** - users use the smart object or smart environment consciously. *No action* is triggered auomatically. (ex. smart light bulb)

**Automation** - smart object decides and reacts automatically. There is *no learning*. (es. automatic curtains)

**Proactivity** - smart object makes their own decision based on data. It learns from experience (context-awareness).

**Explicit interaction** - user is aware, it requires a direct communication

**Implicit interaction** - the system acquires implicit input from the user and may present implicit output to the user



There is a branch of research of both AI and HCI that focuses on user modelling (or user profiling).
