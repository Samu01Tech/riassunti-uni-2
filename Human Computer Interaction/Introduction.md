# Introduction

We are gonna see the fundamental notions of inteaction between humans and computerized system. In particulare we will focus on usability and the application during design and evaluation. 

We will use a Rapid Prototyping Tool: **Axure**.

## Definition

HCI is the study of interaciton between people and computers with the aim to understand and improve interactions.

**Interaction design (IxD)/UX Design** means creating interactive products to support people in their everyday and working life.

- **UI design** is more concerned with the surface and overall feel 
  of a design 

- **UX** covers the *entire spectrum* of the user experience

Actually UI isn't only GUIs but also Voice-controlled interfaces and Gesture-based interfaces.

UX designers determine the **structure** of the interface and the **functionality.** How it’s organized and how all the parts relate to one another.

A good designer knows how to **get into the mindset of his users**, and turns their needs into a meaningful, desirable, and easy-to-use product or service.

> Bad design costs money, time, and lives

Even today, lots of products are badly designed.

To achieve good UX you need to reduce negative aspects and enhancing positve ones.

We go towards a **User-centered design**.

**Goals**:

- improve the interaction between users and computers

- minimize the barrier between the human’s cognitive model of what they want to accomplish and the computer’s understanding of the user’s task

- develop or improve the safety, utility, effectiveness, efficiency, and usability

The **UX Designer role** is **highly collaborative**. The first thing to do is **User Research**.

Conducting research under time and budget constraints needs to be done. Skipping user research has been known to **cost** companies millions; bypassing the initial user research phase is not an option.

## What Is User Experience?

User Experience is a complex psycological response to the interaction with computing system.

> “The User Experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.” - Nielsen and Norman (2014)

To design for quality user experiences: 

- Conceptual frameworks

- Tried and Tested design methods

- Guidelines

- Relevant Research findings

The key is **understanding the user**.

### Design

There are many fields of design, but all of them have common caraterstics: the **double-diamond of design**. This approach has 4 phases that are **iterated**:

1. Discover - gathering informations

2. Define - initial summary

3. Develop - implementation

4. Deliver - finalization and delivery

### Interaction Design (IxD)

Based on **user-centered design**. The goal of this process and creative activity is to develop usable products as weel as an enjoyable user experience. **User-Centered Design** is not on technology but:

- Early focus on user and tasks - studing the behaviour of the user

- Empirical measurement - user reactions and performance

- Iterative design - if problem in testing, they are fixed and do more test

Involving the user is te best way to ensure that the end product is usable and that it will be used.

**Activities:**

1. Discovering requirements - Problem Space
   
   1. what, target user, data gathering and analysis, requirements

2. Designing alternatives - Solution Space
   
   1. Conceptual Design
   
   2. Concrete Design

3. Prototyping alternative design - Soluion Space
   
   1. Involves designing the behavior and the look and feel
   
   2. The most effective way to evaluate the effectivness is to interact with a prototype

4. Evaluating product and its user experience - Solution Space
   
   1. Choose among the alternative design

To design for a good experience, it is important not to jump into decisions from the start. Good designers never start by trying to solve the problem given to them: they start by trying to understand what the real issues are.

- Understand the people who will use the system

- Understand the activities and contexts

- Know about features of interactive technologies

## What is Usability?

Usability is an important quality indicator for interactive systems. Usability refers to the degree to which products are easy to use, easy to learn, effective, efficient, safe to errors and satisfying to users.

Usability is mainly about the functional part of the product: it addresses whether or not you are able to achieve a task or goals with a product.

**Goals**:

- Effectiveness

- Efficiency

- Safety

- Utility

- Learnability

- Memorability

> IDEA OF PILLS DEVICE EASY TO USE

**Usablity criteria:**

- Time to complete a task (efficiency)

- Time to learn a task (learnability)

- Number of errors made when carrying out a given task (memorability/safety)

- ...

However, they do not address the overall quality of the user experience, which is where user experience dimensions come into play.

### UX vs Usability

- Usability is a quality attribute of a product. It is mainly about the functional part of the product

- User experience refers to a person’s subjective feeling and attitudes about using the product

### Usability Testing

Is the practice of testig how easy a design is to use on a group of representative users. You observe users.
