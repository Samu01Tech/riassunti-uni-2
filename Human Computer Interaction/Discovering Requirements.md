# Discovering Requirements

**Objective**:

1. Explore the problem space (PACT)

2. Establish a description of what will be developed

The process is **iterative**.

 A requirement is a **statement** about an intended product that specifies what it is expected to do or how it will perform.

Requirements should be as specific, unambiguous, and clear as possible.

They can be **functional** or **non functional**.

## User stories

```bash
As a <role>, I want <behaviour> so that <benefit>
```

A user story serves as a **starting point** for a conversation to extend and clarify requirements. User stories may also be used to capture **usability and user experience goals**. User stories are most prevalent in **agile** development contexts.
