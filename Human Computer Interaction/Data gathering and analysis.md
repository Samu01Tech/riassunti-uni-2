# Data gathering and analysis

There are 3 main tools:

- Interviews

- Questionnaires

- Observations

The key features to watch are:

1. Goals

2. Identifying partecipants

3. Relationship between collector and provider

4. Triangulation
   
   1. investigator - different researchers
   
   2. methodological - different data gathering techniques

5. Pilot studies
   
   1. test the techniques before use

> In the exam report you should put:
> 
> - Who are the partecipants
> 
> - How we recruited
> 
> - How many involved for each tecnique
> 
> - Distribution of gender, age
> 
> - Other usefull

**Remember to inform user how data are collected and stored**

**Consent forms** are a way to protect the interests of both the gatherer and the data provider

## Interviews and Focus Groups

## Questionnaires

**Options**

- checkboxes - limit options

- ranges - carefull not to overlap data

- likert scale - scale 1 to 5 for example, use odd numbers

- semantic differential scales - choose a point between 2 extremes

combine open and closed questions

Impact of a question could be influenced by the question order, the lenght of them and the clearness.

## The System Usability Scale

When a SUS is used, participants are asked to score the following 10 items with one of five responses that range from Strongly Agree to Strongly disagree:

1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
2. I found the system unnecessarily complex.
3. I thought the system was easy to use.
4. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
5. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
6. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
7. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
8. I found the system very cumbersome to use.
9. I felt very confident using the system.
10. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.

X = sum of odd questions - 5

Y = 25 - sum of even questions

SUS score = (X + Y) * 2.5

Over 68 is fine.

## Questionnaires for User Interaction Satisfaction

Measures the attitude towards different interface factors when using a software for example.

## Emotional responses

They are difficult to measure, one option is emojis. Another one is the use of illustrations.

Used for:

- Valence - pleasant to unpleasant

- Arousal - calm to excited

- Dominance - in control to out of control

It is a Linkert scale.

## Think aloud technique

Consist in listening to users thinking during an observation.

## Quantitative and Qualitative data

Quantitative data are information recorded as numbers. Qualitative data represent charateristics that you don't measure with numbers. 

## Quantitative analysis

- Frequency distribution (mean, range, standard deviation)

- Violin graphs

## Qualitative data

- identify themes
  
  - inductiive analysis: extracting concepts emergent from the data

- categorizing data
  
  - deductive analysis: using predefined categories

- affinity diagrams
